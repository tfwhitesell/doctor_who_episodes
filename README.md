The excellent podcast Radio Free Skaro mentioned in episode 803

that if you started watching one episode of Doctor Who every day starting on June 20, 2021, you would finish the last episode on the 60th anniversary on November 23, 2023. The only list I could find that listed episodes (not just aggregated stories) was on Wikipedia, so I decided to practice a bit of webscraping and data cleaning on a fun project :-)

## Data source
List of Doctor Who Episodes 1963-1989 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(1963%E2%80%931989)

List of Doctor Who Episodes 2005-present - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(2005%E2%80%93present)

I've been wanting to experiment with writing to Google sheets so I plan to add that next. I'll also do some data analysis at some point.
